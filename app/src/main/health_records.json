    "i have headache": "I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Headaches can be really uncomfortable. Have you tried anything to relieve it, like drinking water, resting in a quiet room, or maybe taking a pain reliever if it's safe for you to do so?",
    "ye i try": "That's good to hear. If you've already tried some basic remedies and the headache persists, it might be a good idea to consult a healthcare professional, especially if it's severe or recurring. They can help identify the cause and suggest appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid anything that might exacerbate the pain. If you need any more advice or just someone to talk to, feel free to reach out."
